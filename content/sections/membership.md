The Oxford and Cambridge Society of Austria is committed to providing a vibrant and enriching experience to its members, fostering a sense of community and intellectual stimulation.

The Society offers all alumni of either Oxford or Cambridge the opportunity to become full members by paying an annual subscription fee of 20 EUR. Membership runs for a full calendar year, from January to December. The amount can be paid at any time.

​Full membership entitles the holder to attend member-only events organised by the Society, to benefit from a discounted members-fee for paying events, opportunity to avail discounts for their plus one, and to voting rights at the Annual General Meeting.

​Membership fees are used to subsidise events organised by the Society, as well as to support its day-to-day running.

​Our member-centered approach focuses on understanding the diverse backgrounds and interests of our community, tailoring our events to enrich their experiences.
