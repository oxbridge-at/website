We actively reach out to newly admitted students with a connection to Austria at both universities each year. If you are an Oxbridge Alumnus or Alumna and interested in joining the Society, the best way to get in touch is to visit us at one of the public events advertised here. We do not provide admissions counselling for university applicants.
