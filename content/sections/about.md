We provide past and present students of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and their guests, with a wide variety of events in Austria—stimulating, cultural, or simply fun. *Herzlich willkommen!​*

Rarely do the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge come together, but in Austria, our association unites them. Add the Austrian component, and you get a wonderful mix of the best of British, the best of Austrian, and broader cross-cultural activities. Founded in 1995 - 30 years ago - we are the face of our universities in Austria.

Several events are organised jointly with the societies of other British universities and other leading institutions, including members of the Ivy League.

New to Vienna, or Austria more broadly? Looking to make friends, wanting guidance on Austrian living, or needing intellectual stimulus? OCSA can help! Whether you are long-time residents or newly arrived in Vienna, short-term assignees, United Nations civil servants at the UN’s third 
capital, or visitors passing through—of all ages and professions, from CEOs of multinationals to start-up founders, from retirees to students…

Events are organised by the committee with the support of our members. They 
include dinners with distinguished speakers, informal pub evenings (and pub quizzes), theatre and exhibition visits, and trips to historical sites. We also host an annual welcome event to congratulate students based in Austria on gaining a place at our universities, and a Christmas dinner with carolling - sometimes even sports-themed activities!
