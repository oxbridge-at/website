The Oxford and Cambridge Society of Austria serves past and present members of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge in Austria. We are committed to providing a vibrant and enriching experience to our members and their guests, fostering a sense of community and intellectual stimulation. *Herzlich willkommen*!â€‹

The Society is run by a team of elected volunteers who serve on our Board. Board members are elected for three-year terms by members of the Society, who are invited to attend the Annual General Meeting. We are a non-profit organisation under the Austrian Verein charter and approved by both universities as the Austrian Alumni Society.
