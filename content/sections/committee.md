The Oxford and Cambridge Society of Austria is run by a team of elected volunteers who serve on our committee. Committee members are elected for three-year terms by members of the Society, who are invited to attend the Annual General Meeting. We are a non-profit organisation approved by both universities and regulated by Austrian foundations legislation. The committee consists of alumni of both universities, elected at the Annual General Meeting, who carry out all management-related tasks for the benefit of the Society. In addition to organising events, they are responsible for the day-to-day running of the Society, including finance, communication, and membership administration.
